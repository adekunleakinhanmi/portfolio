<h1>The Best Movies According To Adekunle.</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all Time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>In Time</h3>
<p>A bit old, but I loved the concept of time being the actual currency spent.</p>
<h3>The Vatican's Exorcist</h3>
<p>Great 2023 movie, as you can guess from the title it's "angels vs demons".</p>
<h3>The Great Wall of China</h3>
<p>Also pretty old, bit gory but very captivating.</p>
